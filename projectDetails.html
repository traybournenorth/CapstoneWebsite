        <p id="ProjectDetailText"><b>Project Details</b><br><br>In the past years, students who've taken Intro to Digital Logic have had a difficult time understanding concepts taught throughout the course such as numeric conversions, circuits, and truth tables. A solution was developed in the form of an applet that acted as a tutoring system to help students practice material in an interactive and fun way. Recently, web browsers disabled applets from embedding inside of web pages, which created another problem. DigiTool Inc. plans to take the embedded code and create a breakthrough website that allows students to practice concepts taught in class through enjoyable modules. Each module plans to have progress states that prevent the user from moving onto the next module unless they fully master everything in the module they're currently in. DigiTool Inc. also plans to track the students progress so if they were to log out and log back in, their progress state could remain the same. Modules range from circuits to Karnaugh maps and depending on how far we get throughout this year, the amount of modules could increase greatly. The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor, Xi Zhou. <br><br>Here is the original project proposal

        <p id="TechnologiesText"><b>Technologies</b><br><br>1) GitHub - This tool was used to help manage the version control within our project. This tool allowed our team to constantly update and edit our project through pull requests and pushes. Whenever a teammate made change commit messages were added to each modification so that another person knew what was being changed without having to look throught the whole project code.<br><br>2) Brackets - This IDE was used to develop our team website and various parts of the project. Since this IDE has a live preview option ( programmer is able to see what the application looks like as your working on it ), our team was able to change our website or project in one window while programming at the same time. Bracket's live preview reduced a lot of project time since file dragging or the refreshing of web pages didn't need to happen.<br><br>3) Other tools will be listed as we work on the project.<br><br></p></div>
